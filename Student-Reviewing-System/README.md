# Excel/VBA Student Reviewing System

This Excel Application can be used to track the progress and grades of multiple students. You can create multiple users that can have their own students. Note that user data is stored in a hidden spreadsheet called "masterdata" so it's not secure from other users. This is because the point of the users was to test out how to create different users for this application rather than create an actual secure user system.

A complete xlsm-file and a user manual written in Finnish are included in the repo. Also, all the macros & forms are included separately.

The whole GUI is in Finnish
