# Excel/VBA Ordering System

Excel Spreadsheet Ordering System which I created for the University of Vaasa's course Advanced Spreadsheets. It is based on SAP's ERP design but being Excel Application made for a university course it lacks many features.

A complete xlsm-file with some sample data is included in the repo. Also, all the macros & forms are included separately. 

With this application, you can create and track suppliers, orders, contracts & messages related to them. You can also set automatic orders if the quantity of a product is below the set limit. Scalable prices and fines for late deliveries are also featured in this spreadsheet application

The whole GUI is in Finnish
